# IoTDevices
Internet of things devices libraries

To run using DIO remember to add
-Djava.library.path="/home/pi/dio/build/so" -Djava.security.policy="/home/pi/dio/dio.policy"
to your Java command

Want to learn how this was done?
You can watch the following videos on livecoding.tv where I went through configuring a Raspberry Pi and Grove Pi and showed how to use the library stored here.
