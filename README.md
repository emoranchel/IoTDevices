# IoTDevices
Internet of things devices libraries

To run using DIO remember to add
-Djava.library.path="/home/pi/dio/build/so" -Djava.security.policy="/home/pi/dio/dio.policy"
to your Java command

Want to learn how this was done?
You can watch the following videos on livecoding.tv where I went through configuring a Raspberry Pi and Grove Pi and showed how to use the library stored here.

Download now the Raspberry Pi Image used in the examples, libraries, etc.

Write it to a 2gb (or more) SD Card! using: http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/

Connect your raspberry pi to your pc using the ethernet cable (direct connection)

Putty to the pi IP address: 192.168.127.1 username:pi password:raspberry

The Pi is running a simplified Raspbian (no Desktop GUI environment) with Java, Python, etc. The pi has a DHCP server
